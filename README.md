# 100 Days of Big Data Code Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge! ðŸš€

## Goal
My primary focus during this challenge is on mastering Big Data technologies. I'll be diving deep into the realms of PySpark, Python, Unix, Hadoop, and Google Cloud Platform. This journey is aimed at strengthening my skills, exploring new concepts, and building practical expertise in the world of Big Data.

## Technologies Covered
- **PySpark**: Harnessing the power of Apache Spark with Python for distributed data processing.
- **Python**: Leveraging Python for data manipulation, analysis, and scripting in the Big Data ecosystem.
- **Unix**: Command-line proficiency for efficient data handling and system management.
- **Hadoop**: Understanding the fundamentals of distributed storage and processing with the Hadoop ecosystem.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Exploring cloud-based solutions for scalable and efficient data processing.

## Daily Updates
I'll be posting daily updates on my progress, challenges faced, and the lessons learned. Expect to see code snippets, insights, and possibly some victories (and inevitable setbacks) along the way.

## Why Big Data?
Big Data is the backbone of modern data-driven applications. Mastering these technologies opens doors to scalable solutions, real-time analytics, and insights from vast datasets. Join me on this exciting journey as we conquer the challenges of Big Data together!

Let's code, learn, and grow together! ðŸ’»ðŸ“Š
